# üìò Graphs in Discrete Mathematics

A **graph** is a fundamental concept in discrete mathematics used to model pairwise relations between objects. It consists of two sets:

- A set of **vertices** (or nodes)
- A set of **edges** (that connect pairs of vertices)

---

## ‚úÖ Definition of Graph

A **graph** is denoted by `G = (V, E)` where:

- `V` is a non-empty finite set of **vertices**
- `E` is a finite set of **edges**, where each edge is a pair of vertices.

### üîç Example

Let a graph be:

- `V = {a, b, c, d}`
- `E = { {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {c, d} }`

## üü¶ Types of Graphs

### 1. Null Graph

A graph of order `n` and size `0`, i.e., no edges.

### 2. Simple Graph

A graph with no loops and no more than one edge between any two different vertices.

</p>

### 3. Directed Graph (Digraph)

A graph in which edges have directions. That is, if (u, v) is an edge, it goes from u to v.

</p>

### 4. Multi Graph

A graph that is allowed to have multiple edges (i.e., more than one edge) between two vertices.

### 5. Complete Graph

A graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.

</p>

---

### 6. Regular Graph

A graph where every vertex has the same degree (i.e., the same number of edges).

### 7. Cyclic Graph

A graph that contains at least one cycle (a closed path).

### 8. Bipartite Graph

A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to another set.

### 9. Complete Bipartite Graph

A bipartite graph in which every vertex of one set is connected to every vertex of the other set.

### 10. Undirected Graph

A graph where edges do not have direction. The edge {u, v} is identical to {v, u}.

### 11. Pseudograph

A **Pseudograph** is a graph that allows:

- **Multiple edges** between the same pair of vertices (like a multigraph), and
- **Loops**, i.e., edges that connect a vertex to itself.

This type of graph relaxes the restrictions of a simple graph and is commonly used in network modeling where self-loops and parallel connections are meaningful.

## ‚úÖ Representation of Graphs

Graphs can be represented in various ways depending on the application and type of graph. The most common representations are:

### 1. **Adjacency Matrix**

- A 2D matrix of size `V x V` where `V` is the number of vertices.
- If there is an edge between vertex `i` and vertex `j`, the cell `matrix[i][j]` is marked (usually with 1).
- Suitable for dense graphs.

**Example:**

For a graph with `V = {a, b, c}` and `E = { {a,b}, {b,c} }`:

```
    a  b  c
a [ 0, 1, 0 ]
b [ 1, 0, 1 ]
c [ 0, 1, 0 ]
```

  <img width="300" src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/images/adjacency_directed.jpg" alt="Adjacency Directed Matrix" />
</p>

---

### 2. **Adjacency List**

- Uses a list where each vertex has a list of connected vertices.
- More efficient for sparse graphs.

**Example:**

For the same graph:

```
a ‚Üí b
b ‚Üí a ‚Üí c
c ‚Üí b
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/discrete_mathematics/images/adjacency_list.jpg" alt="Adjacency List" />
</p>

---

### 3. **Incidence Matrix**

- A matrix with rows representing vertices and columns representing edges.
- Each column shows which vertices are connected by the edge.

**Example:**

For `V = {a, b}` and `E = {e1 = {a,b}}`:

```
     e1
a  [ 1 ]
b  [ 1 ]
```

- For directed graphs, 1 is replaced with:

  - `-1` for origin
  - `+1` for destination

    </p>

---

### 4. **Edge List**

- A list of all edges in the graph.
- Simple and minimal representation.

**Example:**

```
Edges:
{a, b}
{b, c}
```
