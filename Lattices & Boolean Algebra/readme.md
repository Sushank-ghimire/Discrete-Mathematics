# 🔢 Lattices and Boolean Algebra (Discrete Structures – Practical Guide)

This guide helps you understand and implement concepts related to **Lattices** and **Boolean Algebra** using the C programming language. These topics are important in fields such as digital logic design, database theory, compiler construction, and AI rule-based systems.

## 📘 What You Should Learn

### 1. 📚 **Lattices**

A **lattice** is a partially ordered set (poset) where every two elements have:

- A **least upper bound (join)** – denoted as `a ∨ b`
- A **greatest lower bound (meet)** – denoted as `a ∧ b`

#### 🔍 Key Terms

- **Poset**: Set + binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
- **Hasse Diagram**: Visual representation of a lattice.
- **Bounded Lattice**: Contains a greatest element (1) and least element (0).
- **Distributive and Modular Lattices**: Special classes based on properties of meet and join.

### 2. 💡 **Boolean Algebra**

A **Boolean algebra** is a bounded distributive lattice with complement laws.

#### 🔍 Key Operations

- **AND** (`∧`): Meet
- **OR** (`∨`): Join
- **NOT** (`¬`): Complement
- **Identities**: a ∨ 0 = a, a ∧ 1 = a, etc.
- **Laws**: Commutative, Associative, Distributive, Identity, Complement

## 🛠️ What to Implement in C

### ✅ 1. Implement Meet and Join

- Create a 2D matrix representing the partial order.
- Write functions to compute `meet(a, b)` and `join(a, b)`.

```c
int meet(int a, int b);
int join(int a, int b);
```
